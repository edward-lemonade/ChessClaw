# Chess Robot

This repo captures my journey to build a prototype chess robot, which may be
turned into a commercial product in the future.

## What is it?

The robot should

 * Visually recongize a physical chess board and chess pieces in it
 * Use A.I. to determine the next move
 * Drive a robot arm to physically move the pieces
 * Verbally interact with the opponent at each stage
